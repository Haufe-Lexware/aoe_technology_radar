## State Januar 2019 ##

After introducing a central "graylog2" service (powered by ICT :-)), there are no "big changes" to logging and even the "small changes" are few - only some update(s) to the Docker-images provided for easier "log-forwarding".

This is no indicator for __logging__ or __central-log management__ going away. On the contrary, providing logging data to the central log service for analysis (think about "Security and Incident Management Systems - SIEM) is a "hot topic" in ITSec and might raise the importance of logging, log-forwarding again. There are no breaking changes to be expected, but it is something to be considered if __log-forwarding__ and the like have not been already on your "requirements-radar".
