## State January 2019 ##

On 14 May, The Haufe Group Network had its first offline event, **Blockchain Lab**, to explore possibilities of using distributed ledger technologies (Blockchain technology) for Haufe Group products. It was a business driven workshop where we discussed and analyzed ideas from seven teams.   
You can read about the **Blockchain Lab** [here](http://work.haufegroup.io/blockchainlab_with_codecetnric/) in our Dev Blog.

To be honest, not many of those ideas were convincing nor did they offer business value.

The idea that emerged from working on blockchain, is to create an [Openbadge](https://openbadges.org/) service for education certificates.
Markus Lobreyer <markus.lobreyer@haufe-lexware.com> and his team are working to deploy the first version in Q2 2019.   

In a possible future step, Open Badges are to be combined with the Blockchain. Read the following [article](https://draftin.com/documents/1138961?token=hQ5q0mCHizZum8-pkDFYUZr4YFYOWMN01BPT-5uX00hAaGxYOAlgAlhyenat76hjNpTCs-CMWPI38KWn_omp0Oc) for more information.
