What happend the last 6 months, what will happen next?

"Next Gen ERP", was started. The project members went to many departments and spoke with all relevant people. The decission was taken that we will start with a Greenfield-Approach instead of migrating the old SAP ERP system.
Beside the implementation of Hana also about 50 systems have to be migrated to SAP ASE. Currently half of the systems have already been migrated. Within the next months the migrations of the SAP BI system will be started. These systems will be migrated first to BW on Hana and later with a Greenfield Approach also to BW4/Hana.
