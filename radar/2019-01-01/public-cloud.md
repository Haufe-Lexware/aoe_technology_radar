Over the past year Haufe Group has continued to grow its level and deepness of public cloud service consumption. While we are staying committed to a two provider strategy for public cloud providers, we also gained much higher levels of service usage penetration in those two public cloud environments. The mantra of new products and services for our customers to first explore their realization possibilities in those two public clouds, has become a corner stone of our tech strategy and integrates nicely with the various upskilling activities on how to use public cloud efficiently and securely. In parallel we put intensive efforts into strengthening our cloud governance posture allowing quicker starting cycles of projects in public cloud while still upholding data security, data privacy and other compliance regulations of Haufe Group.   
We will continue to invest significantly in the governance framework and additionaly, next to new Haufe Group product innovations based on public cloud, fast track cloud migration of classical Enterprise IT application workloads.
