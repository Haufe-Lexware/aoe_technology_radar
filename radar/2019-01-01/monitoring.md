Monitoring is still as important as it already was, if not more.

As there is no "one size fits all", each project has to decide what (monitoring-) solution or technology fits best. For cloud - centric solutons and deployments (think Azure, AWS, ... projects), just look for monitoring services etc. on the platform your project is being deployed to. Using anything "platform-native" should be the most efficient choice and get the best 
price-performance ratio.


Still there are some "names" coming up more often than others:

[NewRelic](https://www.newrelic.com/): Monitoring infrastructure, application and usage metrics.

[App Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview): Know what happens in / with your application(s)

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/): An open source solution for timeseries data like metrics with a whole bunch of solutions for querying, alerting and visualization.
