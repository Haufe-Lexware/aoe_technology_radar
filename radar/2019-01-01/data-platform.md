## State Januar 2019 ##

The Data Lake Engineering team was established.
A first technical concept of Data Platform architecture was created. The concept was based on building data lake infrastructure on Azure cloud platform using native managed data services and Kylo as an data ingestion mechanism.
The technical concept was redesigned due to the decision of moving from Azure infrastructure to AWS infrastructure.
The new concept is based on using Apache NiFi as self-service data integration tool and AWS reference data lake architecture based on API Gateway, S3, Lambda Functions, Spark on EMR, Glue and Athena.   
The first delivery is planned for Q3 2019.
The first use case was agreed. It is one of Machine Learning use cases currently worked on.
The team works closely with CISO in order to establish best practices and pragmatic solutions in area of data security and governance, system security and code security.
