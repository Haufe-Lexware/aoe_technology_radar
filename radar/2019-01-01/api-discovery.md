## State Januar 2019 ##

API discovery offers listing and search functionality for available (but possibly unknown) APIs.

At Haufe, an implementation based on http://apis.io/ was *evaluated*, but was __discarded__ because of the somewhat fragile implementation and very few updates of the original source code.

Based on the number of APIs provided by Teams at Haufe for internal or public use, the need for an API discovery solution will be reconsidered.
