The Chatbot for Haufe Shop has been deployed to productio and is now tested and optimized with real user behavior and feedback. The purpose of the chatbot is, for now, a product recommender. We optimize the bot in a first iteration on our page with real user feedback to head than in a next iteration towards messenger networks like Facebook messenger or Microsoft Teams.

While the set-up of a Chatbot is quite easily done within weeks, the training of a bot is very ressource intensive and shouldn’t be underestimated.
