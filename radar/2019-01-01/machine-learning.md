#General

The continuing journey to understand and master machine learning as a core technical comtepency at Haufe Group
In some projects like HZM and in LexOffice, ML is being incorporated into the working discussions of the product teams and so itâ€™s also a valid point for learning how to work with ML. 
Several initiatives have taken place:
-	AI Foundation (CTO initiative) 
-	Customer Analytics
-	Initiatives, projects and cells
-	Brown Bags, ML Days

#1. AI Foundation (CTO initiative)

Haufe Group is seeking to add machine learning as a core technology to the company technology strategy and as a general programming skill for developers. ML has the potential to provide our customers with much added value and opens new possibilities for software solutions: A must-learn for the Haufe Group. 

Haufe Group has teamed up with AWS to offer upskillings for software engineers who want to do projects with machine learning.

##AI Courses
Three one-week machine learning trainings with AWS professional sevices trainers, especially tailored for developers who want to increase  their ML skills. Data was used from real world Haufe use-cases like churn prediction, recommender engines or search optimization. 
Because of the large number of about 40 interested colleagues from all Haufe Group subsidiaries the course was split into two cycles. The first cycle has already finished and took place in Freiburg, Timisoara and Barcelona.
