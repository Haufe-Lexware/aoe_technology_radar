## State Januar 2019 ##

Serverless architecture is now fully accepted in Haufe Group.
More and more solutions and services use serverless technology.
Despite the fact that serverless is highly cloud provider specific, teams prefer the technology cause it offers advantages regarding reduced infrastructure maintenance efforts and costs.   
Therefore the classification changed from **productize** to **scale**.

## Our projects ##

* HRS
The HRS team finished reengineering of the EDB (court decision database) based on serverless technology.
Nils Rhode <nils.rhode@haufe-lexware.com> presented the approach and outcome at several conferences like AWS Summit, [x-celerate](https://www.x-celerate.de/) and Haufe internal community days.
