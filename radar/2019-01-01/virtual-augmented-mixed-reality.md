A new network cell called **ImmersiveNow** showed up and took over.
The cell got budget for a VR lab. It is located in building 6.1.
The **ImmersiveNow team** bought hardware to be able to experiment with it.
* Oculus Go
* Hololens
* Zeiss VR One
* Samsung VR gear

The team implemented the following apps:
* **Memory cards app**   
Memory cards app is running on Hololens. The team also refactored it, so it can ran on smartphones (Android and iOS).   
A new backend is created to support more topics than the existing presidents and planets.
* **Lampenfieber app**   
The app is being created by the partner medialesson. The ImmersiveNow team will maintain it.
